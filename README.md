# Snipstring
Python project which takes a screenshot and converts it to string, then copy that string to clipboard as well as in a text file and then speaks the content of text file using sapi voice.
So this project is basically inspired by snipping tool which is already present in windows.
OCR(Optical character recognition) is used in this project.
